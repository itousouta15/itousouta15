## 👋 Hi, I'm Itou Souta!

> “The world goes quiet when I write code.”

Welcome to my digital playground!  
I'm a **high school student from Taiwan** with a passion for **C++**, **web development**, and **cybersecurity**.  
Here, I share my experiments, learning notes, and personal projects. I believe that every line of code is a step toward understanding the world—and myself—a little better.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

I started programming out of curiosity, wanting to know how websites and games were made.  
Over time, my interests expanded to algorithms, competitive programming, and cybersecurity.  
I enjoy participating in online coding challenges and CTFs, and I love breaking down complex problems into elegant solutions.

Recently, I've been diving into frontend frameworks, static site generators, and experimenting with AI tools.  
My goal is to build useful, beautiful, and secure digital experiences.
