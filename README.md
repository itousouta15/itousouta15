## 👋 Hi, I'm Itou Souta!

> “The world goes quiet when I write code.”

Welcome to my digital playground!  
I'm a **High school student from Taiwan** with a passion for **C++**, **web development**, and **cybersecurity**.  
Here, I share my experiments, learning notes, and personal projects. I believe that every line of code is a step toward understanding the world—and myself—a little better.
