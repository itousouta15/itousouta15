## Hi, I'm Itou Souta!
> *“The world goes quiet when I write code.”*  

I'm a **high school student from Taiwan** passionate about **C++**, **web development**, and **cybersecurity**.  
Here, I share my projects, experiments, and learning notes. For me, every line of code is a step toward understanding both the world — and myself — a little better.  


## About Me
